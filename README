The primary problem I use is Vacuum World which is
briefly described below.

Vacuum World

The world is a grid of some width and height (specified)

Each location on the grid can have dirt. The goal of the
problem is to remove all the dirt formt he grid.

An agent cleaning the grid can move left right up and down and
it can suck up the dirt.

Usage: ./vacuum_world.py [-ibdga] [-m n] [-n] [-s n] width height

   -m --max n    Set maximum depth for depth first search
   -n --nograph  Use a tree instead of graph for state space
   -s --seed n   Seed the random number generator
